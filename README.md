# CC-CEDICT-additions
A  collection of tools/scripts aimed to create some additions for CC-CEDICT automatically, for things such asplace names
This will be done by querying Wikidata, and possibly by other methods too
Note that as these are automatically generated, they are not 100% reliable, for example, many characters have multiple pinyin readings, also, some words/names do not necessarily use equivalent characters in the simplified and traditional words. For this reason, they cannot be included in CC-CEDICT.
